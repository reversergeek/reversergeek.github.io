= Reverse Engineering Crackme_v2 Write Up.

=== First Impressions:

A quick run of the program shows us that it's a command line program. The crackme outputs some strings and takes 2 inputs: serial, and name.

The readme.txt file tells us that the crackme is written in C++ and our goal is to write a keygen, not patch the software.

A quick PEiD scan detects no packer/crypter signatures.

Opening in IDA shows us the code the same strings that we saw in the command line being passed to std:cout and name and serial being comming from std:cin being stored in `var_108` and `var_208` respectivley. I'll rename those variables `szName` and `szSerial`.

=== Reverse Engineering Serial Checking Algorithem:

You can see in the image above (still in the main function, just scrolled down a little) that this crackme's has only one conditional branch that leads to either ``"Error : : Not a correct Serial\n"` and `"Correct : : Good Work\n"`.


The code leading up the `cmp` and `jmp` that make that conditional branch will be the algorithem that checks to see if the serial and name are correct. Let's have a look at it, shall we:


First the length of `szName` is determined with `strlen()`:

....
lea     eax, [ebp+szName]
mov     [esp], eax      ; char *
call    _strlen
....

Next the length is multiplied by `0x875CD` (554445d) and again by `0x51eb851f` (1374389535d) but this time the result goes into the `edx:edx` register pair.  `eax` is them moved into `edx`, nulling the least significant half of the quad word, effectively dividing by `0x64` which is 2**32:

....
mov     edx, eax
imul    edx, 875CDh
mov     eax, 51EB851Fh
mul     edx
mov     eax, edx
....

Shift right is used to divide by 2**5, ie 32:

....
shr     eax, 5
....

Then multiplication by `0x0FFFFFC90` which is -880d:

....
imul    eax, 0FFFFFC90h
....

Next `_sprintf` is used to convert the floating point into a string with "-x019871" appended to it. Eg: -50.0 becomes "-50-x019871". This is what the serial needs to be. If you were stepping though with a debugger then you would see desired serial in `var_308`.

....
mov     edx, 0
push    edx
push    eax
fild    qword ptr [esp]
lea     esp, [esp+8]
fstp    [ebp+var_410]
fld     [ebp+var_410]
fstp    qword ptr [esp+8]
mov     dword ptr [esp+4], offset aIX019871 ; "%i-x019871"
lea     eax, [ebp+var_308]
mov     [esp], eax      ; char *
call    _sprintf
....

....
lea     eax, [ebp+var_308]
mov     [esp+4], eax    ; char *
lea     eax, [ebp+szSerial]
mov     [esp], eax      ; char *
call    _strcmp
mov     [ebp+var_414], eax
cmp     [ebp+var_414], 0
jz      short loc_401719
....

Putting that all together we get the following equation:

....
int2str(((((strlen(name) * 554445) * 1374389535 ) /(2**32)) /32 ) * -880) + "-x019871"
....

A bit of maths....

....
1374389535/(2**32)/32
=1/100
....

can simplify the equation into: 

....
((strlen(name) * 554445  / 100) * -880)
....

And there's our keygen algorithem. We could just get the output of sprintf or type up a keygen in our language of choosing.

....
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char name[100];
    double serial_number;
	
    cout << "name: ";
    cin >> setw(sizeof name) >> name;
	
    serial_number = (long double)(-880 * (554445 * strlen(name) / 0x64));
	
    printf("%i-x019871\n", serial_number);
    //cout << "Hellow world" << endl;
	
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
....
