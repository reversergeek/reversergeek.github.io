= Challenger Analysing the File Format

== Analysing the Files

I encrypted my copy of PEiD.exe and it produced PEiD.exe.cha. I also encrypted a  readme.txt file which produced readme.cha. Both encrypted .cha files are 71 bytes larger than their origionals. This suggests a 71 byte header. Let's look at them in a hex dump and compare them.

These are binary files. You can see the green bytes are the same and the yellow bytes are different. You can also see that the last 3 bytes of the 71 bytes header denotes the file plaintext file's file extention.

Let's see what happens if we encrypt the same file with two different keys.

This time different information changes and different information stays the same between the two compared files.

Thirdly we'll see if there's any difference in the .cha files produced by encrypting the same file twice with the same key.

So some bytes always stay the same. Some bytes always change. Some bytes only change with different keys. And some bytes change with different files.

In summary, according to analysis of the few files I've made in this one virtual machine:

* The first 24 bytes are allways the same.
* The following 4 bytes are different in every file.
* The following 8 bytes are the same in every file.
* The following 8 bytes are the different if there are different keys.
* The following 12 bytes are different in every file.
* The following 2 bytes are different if the file or key is different.
* The following 3 bytes are the same in every file.
* The following 4 bytes are the diffrent if there are different keys.
* The following 3 bytes are the same in every file.
* The following x bytes are clearly a copy of the plaintext's file extention and will be as long as that file extention is (I checked by encrypting a file with a 6 letter extention).
* The following bytes are all variable and must be the ciphertext.

We can get a clue as to what each set of bytes is doing by modifying them and seeing how the programs behaviour is different with the modified file. For example:
* Modifying bytes in the first 16 (but not the following 8) bytes causes Challenger to offer to 'encrypt', rather than 'decrypt'. This must be because the file isn't recognised as a .cha file since the magic number that is recognised have been modified. This shows us that that magic number is the first 16 bytes.

That's everything we can tell from the files. Let's do some debugging...
